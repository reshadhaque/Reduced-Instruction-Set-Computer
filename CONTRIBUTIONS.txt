Both partners Reshad and Apaar worked together on Lab7_top, and adding states to the controller state machine
using peer programming, while taking turns and pointing out each other's mistakes. We added extra output signals while following the diagrams of the labs 5, 6 and lab 7.


Connected everything in lab7_top and debugged together using waveforms, going through each
state,and keeping track manually. We added extra combinational logic which was required as shown in
the lab document and finally combinational logic for the I/O part.
